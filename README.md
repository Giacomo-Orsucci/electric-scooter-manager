# electric-scooter-manager
Web manager for electric-scooter

The program is designed assuming the optic of a public administration that needs to manage the electric scooter stations in its area. 
The repository includes the front-end and the back-end.

The program is in Italian, I hope this is not a problem in usability. You can also find a report about the program (in Italian) and all its design phase.

This program can be used completely free for learning purposes
